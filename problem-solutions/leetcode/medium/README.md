## üéØ Study Strategy

### Time Management
- **Medium problems**: Target 20-30 minutes each
- **Complex problems**: Up to 45 minutes acceptable
- **Focus on understanding** over speed

### Approach
1. **Identify the core pattern** first
2. **Start with brute force** if needed
3. **Optimize systematically** 
4. **Consider trade-offs** (time vs space)
5. **Practice multiple approaches** when possible
