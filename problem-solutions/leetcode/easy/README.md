## üéØ Study Strategy

### Daily Approach
1. **Read problem statement** carefully
2. **Identify the pattern** (Two Pointers, Hash Map, etc.)
3. **Think of brute force** solution first
4. **Optimize** step by step
5. **Code the solution** with proper variable names
6. **Test with examples** and edge cases
7. **Analyze complexity** and document

### Time Management
- **Easy problems**: Target 10-15 minutes each
- **If stuck**: Look at hints, then solution approach
- **After solving**: Read discuss section for alternative approaches
