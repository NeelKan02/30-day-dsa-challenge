**Status**: ⏳ Pending  
**Focus**: Consolidation and assessment of Week 1 learning

## 🎯 Today's Goals
- [ ] Review all Week 1 implementations
- [ ] Practice mixed problems from arrays, linked lists, stacks
- [ ] Identify knowledge gaps and areas for improvement
- [ ] Create summary notes and cheat sheets
- [ ] Prepare for Week 2 topics

## 📚 Review Session (45 minutes)
- [ ] Arrays: Review dynamic array and sorting algorithms
- [ ] Linked Lists: Review singly and doubly linked implementations
- [ ] Stacks: Review both implementations and applications
- [ ] Big O analysis for all operations learned

## 💻 Code Review (45 minutes)
