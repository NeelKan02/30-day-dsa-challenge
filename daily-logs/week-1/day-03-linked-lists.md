- [ ] Master pointer manipulation techniques
- [ ] Implement singly linked list from scratch
- [ ] Solve 5 fundamental linked list problems
- [ ] Compare arrays vs linked lists trade-offs

## 📚 Theory Study (45 minutes)
- [ ] Linked list vs array comparison
- [ ] Node structure and pointers
- [ ] Memory allocation patterns
- [ ] Time complexity analysis

## 💻 Implementation (45 minutes)
- [ ] Singly linked list class
- [ ] Basic operations: insert, delete, search, traverse
- [ ] Edge case handling
