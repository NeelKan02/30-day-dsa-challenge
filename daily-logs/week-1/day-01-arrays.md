## üìñ Theory Study Session

### Array Fundamentals

**Memory Layout:**
- Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations
- Each element can be accessed in O(1) time using index
- Index calculation: `base_address + (index * element_size)`

**Time Complexities:**
| Operation | Time Complexity | Explanation |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Access | O(1) | Direct index calculation |
| Search | O(n) | May need to check all elements |
| Insertion | O(n) | May need to shift elements |
| Deletion | O(n) | May need to shift elements |

**Space Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of elements

### Dynamic Arrays vs Static Arrays

**Static Arrays:**
- Fixed size determined at compile time
- Memory allocated on stack (for small arrays)
- Cannot change size after creation

**Dynamic Arrays:**
- Size can change during runtime
- Memory allocated on heap
- Automatic resizing when capacity is exceeded
- Examples: Python lists, C++ vectors, Java ArrayLists

### Key Concepts to Remember
- **Indexing:** 0-based in most languages
- **Bounds checking:** Prevent index out of range errors
- **Resizing strategy:** Typically double capacity when full
- **Amortized analysis:** Average O(1) insertion despite occasional O(n) resize

## üíª Implementation Session

### Dynamic Array Implementation Plan

**Class Structure:**
```python
class DynamicArray:
    def __init__(self, capacity=1)
    def __len__(self)
    def __getitem__(self, index)
    def __setitem__(self, index, value)
    def append(self, value)
    def insert(self, index, value)
    def delete(self, index)
    def resize(self, new_capacity)
```

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Start with initial capacity of 1
- Double capacity when array is full
- Handle edge cases (empty array, invalid indices)
- Maintain size vs capacity distinction

**Testing Strategy:**
- Test basic operations (append, access, delete)
- Test edge cases (empty array, single element)
- Test resizing behavior
- Verify time complexities with large datasets

- Use slow and fast pointers
- Modify array in-place

### Problem 3: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (#121)
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Approach:** Single pass with min tracking  
**Status:** [ ] Not Started / [ ] In Progress / [ ] Completed

**Key Insights:**

### Problem 4: Rotate Array (#189)
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Approach:** Multiple methods to explore  
**Status:** [ ] Not Started / [ ] In Progress / [ ] Completed

**Key Insights:**
