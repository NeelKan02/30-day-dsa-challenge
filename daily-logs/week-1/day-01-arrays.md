# Day 1 - Arrays Foundation 🚀
**Date**: July 7, 2025  
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress  
**Time Goal**: 1.5 hours  

## 🎯 Today's Goals
- [ ] Understand array memory layout and indexing
- [ ] Learn time complexity of array operations
- [ ] Implement dynamic array from scratch
- [ ] Solve 5 fundamental array problems
- [ ] Set up progress tracking system

## 📚 Theory Study (45 minutes)

### Array Fundamentals
- [ ] **Memory Layout**: How arrays are stored contiguously in memory
- [ ] **Indexing**: Zero-based indexing and access patterns
- [ ] **Time Complexity**: 
  - Access: O(1)
  - Search: O(n)
  - Insertion: O(n) worst case, O(1) amortized for dynamic arrays
  - Deletion: O(n)

### Key Concepts to Master
- [ ] Static vs Dynamic arrays
- [ ] Array resizing strategies
- [ ] Memory allocation and deallocation
- [ ] Cache locality and performance implications

## 💻 Implementation Task (45 minutes)

### Dynamic Array Implementation
Create `implementations/arrays/dynamic_array.py` with:
- [ ] Initial capacity and resize logic
- [ ] Basic operations: get, set, append, insert, delete
- [ ] String representation
- [ ] Size and capacity tracking

## 🧩 Problem Solving (45 minutes)
