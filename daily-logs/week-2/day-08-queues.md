**Focus**: Queue fundamentals and FIFO operations

## 🎯 Today's Goals
- [ ] Understand FIFO principle and queue operations
- [ ] Implement queue using array and linked list
- [ ] Learn circular queue concepts
- [ ] Solve 5 fundamental queue problems
- [ ] Master BFS traversal patterns

## 📚 Theory Study (45 minutes)
- [ ] FIFO principle and queue ADT
- [ ] Array vs linked list vs circular implementation
- [ ] Queue applications in algorithms
- [ ] BFS and level-order traversal
